\fBInstallation Instructions for aplc, the APL compiler\fP
.PP
The output of the apl compiler is a C program, which includes a file
defining the run time system.  The first step in installation depends upon
whether the compiler is intended for a single user, or for use on a system
wide basis.
.SH
Single User Use
.PP
Make sure line 44 of the file dcls.c issues an include in double quote
form, instead of using angle braces.
Note that the file aplc.h must be in the same directory as any apl program
that is compiled.
.SH
System Wide Use
.PP
Move the file aplc.h to where include files live (usually /usr/include).
Make sure line 44 of the file dcls.c issues an include in angle brace
form, instead of using double quotes.
.SH
Compiling the sources
.PP
Type \fImake all\fP in the sources directory.  This should take about half
an hour of compilation time.  You might want to redirect the output and go
have lunch.
.SH
Changing the shell script
.PP
This assumes (naturally) that everything compiled ok.
There is one hard path coded in the shell script called \fIaplc\fP.
Change this to point to the binaries created in the last step, and move the
shell script to wherever appropriate.
.SH
A Test Case
.PP
There is one program, ulam.apl, included in the source directory.
Try typing \fIaplc ulam.apl\fP.  If this succeeds without complaint, type
\fIa.out\fP.  It should prompt for a number, try 10.  It will result in a
sprial of numbers of the given size, then replace the primes by stars and
the nonprimes by spaces.  The resulting pattern exhibits some interesting
lines.
